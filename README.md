# Portfolio Project 3 - SQL - COVID-19 Data

Welcome to my third portfolio project. In this data cleaning and analysis project, I analyse a COVID-19 dataset.

**Project Guide**

In this project, I use SQL to investigate and determine which countries / continents had the highest infection rate amongst their population, who had the highest death rate, summing global infection rate, death rate, number of vaccinations, percentage of population vaccinated on each date etc.

In doing so, I utilise various SQL queries including "JOIN"s, "WITH"s, excluding continental aggregate data when analysing country-wise data with "!=" (NOT EQUAL TO), calculating new columns from existing columns, creating "VIEW"s and temp tables, and aliasing with "AS".

I first split the original dataset into 2 tables - one containing various COVID deaths data (covid_deaths), and the other containing various COVID vaccinations data (covid_vaccinations). This enabled me to demonstrate "JOIN"s on the 2 tables.

During data import, some of the columns wouldn't be imported as the data type that they should be, for example a numeric column being imported as a text column and refusing to be converted to a numeric column even during manual import. Therefore, during analysis, I made use of SQL's "CAST" function, which allows me to cast the data into my desired data type for the purposes of my querying and analysis.
