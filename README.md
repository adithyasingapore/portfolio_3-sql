# Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - AdventureWorks

Welcome to my third portfolio project. In this data cleaning and analysis project, I analyse a COVID-19 dataset using various SQL queries.

There is 1 project file (SQL) and 2 data table files (2 CSVs) in this repository.

I first split the original dataset into 2 tables - one containing various COVID deaths data (covid_deaths), and the other containing various COVID vaccinations data (covid_vaccinations). This enabled me to demonstrate JOINs on the 2 tables.
