COVID-19 Analysis with SQL

The dataset has been downloaded and split into two CSVs, imported as two tables:
covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations. This has been done to allow me to demonstrate JOINS.

-- Initial query for the covid_deaths table
SELECT * FROM covid_deaths
	ORDER BY location, date;

-- Initial query for the covid_vaccinations table
SELECT * FROM covid_vaccinations
	ORDER BY location, date;



-- Summary data overview of the covid_deaths table
SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
	FROM covid_deaths
	ORDER BY location, date;



-- Calculating death percentage from total_cases and total_deaths
-- Shows likelihood of death if a person contracts COVID-19 in each particular country.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, CAST(total_deaths as decimal) AS total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
	FROM covid_deaths
	ORDER BY location, date;
/* NOTE:
SQL imported the total_deaths column as "varchar" date type, which is not numeric.
This is why I have CAST the data type into a numeric data type, in order to calculate.
Also, for some reason, data types 'numeric', 'int' and 'bigint' gave errors.
So I have used 'decimal' data type instead. The results are still whole numbers. */



-- Calculating infection percentage from total_cases and population
-- Shows spread of COVID-19 (number of cases) amongst the population of India
-- Changing the WHERE clause location to a different country will give the infection percentage for that country.
SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, (total_cases/population)*100 AS infection_percentage
	FROM covid_deaths
	WHERE location = 'India'
	ORDER BY location, date;
/* NOTE:
If you run my scripts and encounter any numeric columns not calculated properly,
e.g. when ORDER BY descending, 997 appears before 8240, this is because SQL has imported
it as "varchar" and is ordering variable characters 9 before 8, instead of numeric size.
This is due to auto-assigning of column data types by SQL when importing the CSV data.
So, please use the CAST function to cast it into a numeric column wherever needed.*/



-- Listing countries by highest infection rate amongst population
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS highest_infection_count, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS infection_percentage
	FROM covid_deaths
	GROUP BY location, population
	ORDER BY infection_percentage DESC;



-- Listing countries by highest number of deaths amongst population
SELECT location, continent, population, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS decimal)) AS total_death_count
	FROM covid_deaths
	WHERE continent != ""
	GROUP BY location, population
	ORDER BY total_death_count DESC;
/* NOTE:
Aggregate figures for "World", "Europe" etc. have been included in our dataset.
So when we order by descending, these large figures appear at the top.
We only want countries' figures, so we can exclude these global/continental figures.
e.g. "North America" is listed under 'location', its 'continent' is empty but not NULL.
So we add WHERE continent != (not equal to) "" (empty) to exclude these aggregate figures.
If it was NULL instead of empty, we would use WHERE continent IS NOT NULL.

-- Now, we let's analyse by continent
-- Listing the continents by highest death count
SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS decimal)) AS total_death_count
	FROM covid_deaths
	WHERE continent = ""
	AND location NOT IN ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
	GROUP BY location
	ORDER BY total_death_count DESC;
/* NOTE:
We are now using WHERE continent = "" (is equal to empty). The '!' before '=' is removed.
This will provide us the aggregate continental and world figures.
We exclude 'World' and 'International' as they are not continents.
We also exclude 'European Union' (EU) as the EU is a part of 'Europe'. */
